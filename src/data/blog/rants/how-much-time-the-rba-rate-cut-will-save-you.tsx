                Today&apos;s rate cut from the RBA is long awaited by many. With
                it will come a slew of talk about how much money the average
                punter will save. But if you&apos;re like me and want to
                maintain the same repayments regardless of the interest rate,
                you&apos;ll want to know how much quicker you can pay off your
                mortgage.

            <BlogParagraph>
                Today&apos;s rate cut is 0.25%. With most retail interest rates
                around the 6% mark, this will be a saving of about $80 a month,
                on a $500,000 mortgage.
            </BlogParagraph>
            <BlogParagraph>
                However, if we maintain the same repayments we can look at how
                this will affect the time it takes to pay off the mortgage.

            <BlogParagraph>
                The following chart compares a $500,000 mortgage with $4000
                repayments at a 6% interest rate and what would be the new 5.75%
                interest rate.

                At the 6% interest rate, you&apos;ll pay off the mortgage in 16
                years and 6 months. At the new interest rate you&apos;ll reach
                the end a whole 4 months faster!

                Not quite as exciting as I&apos;d hoped for! But maybe with a
                few more cuts we might be able to shave off a few years.
